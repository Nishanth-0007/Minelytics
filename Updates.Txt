Week - 1
Data Collection is completed
    a) A large Soil Images Dataset was made using below datasets:

    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/matshidiso/soil-types

    b) A 25 years fuel used, coal mined and carbon emitted dataset was generated (synthetic dataset) as there was no available dataset


Week - 2:
Data Preprocessing is completed for the soil images dataset and data split is been done into test, train and validation.

Week - 3:
LSTM model is built and trained on the fuel used, coal mined and carbon emitted dataset. The model is saved as `lstm_co2_predictor.h5`.

some changes to LSTM model to improve accuracy and reduce loss were done. Now the model is working fine with good accuracy and low loss. Chnages to week 3 code.

Week - 4, 5 & 6:
Building CNN Model and Prediction System for soil images dataset. 
    a) Building CNN model
    b) Training and evaluating the model
    c) Saving the model as `soil_cnn_model.h5`
    d) Building prediction system using the saved model
    e) Testing the prediction system with custom images
